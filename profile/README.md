# Welcome to Formalsec!

**Formalsec** is dedicated to enhancing system security through the power of formal methods, connecting rigorous research with real-world cybersecurity challenges.

We follow the OCaml community's code of conduct, see our copy in this repository. This applies to all repositories under the formal organisation (even if they don't have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in the source code yet).
